# DIGITS Python3

My attempt at updating [NVIDIA DIGITS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/) for Python 3 compatibility. 

[Python 2.7 will not be maintained past 2020](https://pythonclock.org/). Starting new projects in Python 2.7 is just asking for techinical debt you don't need.

## Install instructions.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04. But should work on in environment DIGITS and Python3 works.

Clone this project:

    git clone https://github.com/jed-frey/DIGITS.git ~/DIGITS

To keep my OS's Python environment clean I prefer to work in [Virtual Environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). Create a Python 3 virtual environment called ```digits_venv3``` & activate it.

	VENV=digits_venv3
    virtualenv --python=$(which python3) ~/${VENV}
    source ~/${VENV}/bin/activate
    
Setup DIGITS

    cd ~/DIGITS
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py develop
    
Run Digits.

	digits-devserver
	
or

	digits-devserver --debug

## Issues

It doesn't work just yet. No fancy mailing list, just use the issues list as it was intended.
